input stream inputs data to program 
ouputs stream outputs data from program 



Data -> I/P Stream -> Variable -- so input streams reads that from device and updates variable eg. cin >> a; reads from stdin and update a with value

Variable -> O/P Stream -> Data -- So, output stream puts the variables from program as data on to device. eg. cout << "Data Var"; puts "Data var" onto stdout ~output stream 


File Stream: 

ofstream -> to create new file and write in it 
ifstream -> open existing file for reading
fstream -> open existing file for reading or writing 

binary files are char oriented in CPP
